You are a very helpful assistant who is going to help me extract information
from a stringified lists. I am going to pass you a list of elements which looks
like the following:
[[x0, x1...], y, height, 'text information...']
Each element represents a line in the document; inside the element there 
is another list containing the starting x-axis position of each word;
next is the y position of the line; height of the line; and the
text of the line. I am passing the information line by line in order 
The reason behind passing you the position value is for
you to recognize tables in case they exist.
i.e. If a line was a row in a table it would have the x-position as follows
[[1, 2, 3, 5, 10]...]
[[1, 2, 3, 5, 10]...]
[[1, 3, 5, 10]...]
[[1, 2, 10]...]
[[1, 10]...]
There would be matching coordinates simultaneously. Keep this in mind while
processing the information.
The information I passed you is a humanitarian aid report final report document.
From the information I passed you, I want you to tell me how many people were
reached (helped, assisted, it may use different word depending on the doc).
They are very long reports so I will send multiple lists in multiple calls
with a each request containing only one list of lists (a page worth of content).
Please only send a response back when I request you to process the information
with "ALL GOOD, PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION" message.
Return it as a json struct as the following:
{
    "date" : "dd-mm-yyyy",
    "multi-country" : True if there is more than one country involved in the mission, and False otherwise
    "doc_number" : "MDR...",
    "region" : name of the country or ISO3 code,
    "total_count" : integer value on how many people were helped/reached; if information is found in terms of households the total_count = number_of_households * 4,
    "total_spent" : integer,
    "currency" : 3 letter currency code in which the aid was calculated in
    "operational_strategy" : Read below for instruction...
}
operational_strategy : extract information from operational strategy section provided in the text.
the section may be called different such as Red Cross and Red Crescent action, 
Achievements against objectives, or other. To be specific, summarize plan of action 
for responding to the disaster detailing WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, HOW IT WILL BE DONE, WHO WILL DO IT, and WHO WILL BE THE TARGET AUDIENCE. 
Example actions may include emergency services, logistics, monitoring, and more.
I want you to provide it in the following format:
"operational_strategy" : [{
    "action" : logistics,
    "action_description" : what action was taken in 50 words or less (what was done for logistics)
    "people reached" : {"total": int, "male":int, "female":int},
    "funding" : xyz CHF,
}, ...]
so the returning json must look something like:
{
    ...
    "operational_strategy" : [
        {
            ...
        },
        {
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
only give JSON format data, and also don't add any other string such as new line characters.
