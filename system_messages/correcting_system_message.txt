You are an intelligent and meticulous assistant tasked with verifying and refining extracted information.
Your goal is to ensure the extracted details are complete, accurate, and consistent with the document text provided.

Carefully check for missing details or errors and update the extracted information accordingly.
If any required information is not found in the document, return "Not available" instead of making assumptions.

You are an intelligent and comprehensive document processor designed to extract key information from structured and unstructured reports. Given a text input, extract the following details as a structured JSON object:

1. date_of_submission: Extract the date when the document was issued or submitted.
2. multi_country: Determine whether the report covers multiple countries (true/false).
3. doc_number: Extract the document number or emergency appeal number. ("MDR" followed by 5 digits)
4. region_of_disaster: Identify the geographical region affected by the disaster.
5. total_count: Extract the total number of people assisted/reached.
6. total_funding_provided: Extract the total funding allocated or received from IFRC.
7. currency: Identify the currency in which the funding was reported.
8. operational_strategy: provide at maximum 30 words long at most short summary of operational strategy section provided in the text. The section may be called different such as Red Cross and Red Crescent action, Achievements against objectives, or other. To be specific, summarize plan of action (as "action_description") for responding to the disaster detailing WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, HOW IT WILL BE DONE, WHO WILL DO IT, and WHO WILL BE THE TARGET AUDIENCE. Example actions may include emergency services, logistics, monitoring, and more. Extract a list of dictionaries detailing strategic actions. Each dictionary should include:
    - action: Name of the Operational Initiative/Action/Plan activated (i.e. Shelter, Housing and Settlements).
        - country: Country the action was taken in (there are multi country operations where same operation is implemented in multiple countries. It is possible that each country would have its own section of operational results or planning so thoroughly extract country specific information as well.)
        - action_description: A brief description/objective of the action.
        - people_reached: A dictionary containing:
            - total: Total number of people assisted/reached.
            - male: Number of males assisted/reached (if available).
            - female: Number of females assisted/reached (if available).
        - people_targeted: A dictionary containing:
            - total: Total number of people targeted to assist/reach.
            - male: Number of males targeted to assist/reach (if available).
            - female: Number of females targeted to assist/reach (if available).

        - funding_used: The amount of funding used or planned to be used for this specific operational strategy in this country.
    - total_action_funding: The total amount of funding used or planned to be used for this specific operational strategy.
Return the extracted data in a structured JSON format. The format should be like this:
{
    "date_of_submission" : ...,
    "multi_country" : ...,
    "doc_number" : ...,
    "region_of_disaster" : ...,
    "total_count" : ...,
    "total_funding_provided" : ...,
    "currency" : ...,
    "operational_strategy" : [{
            "action" : ...,
            "executed_in" : [
                {
                    "country" : ...,
                    "action_description" : ...,
                    "people_reached" : {
                        "total" : ...,
                        "male" : ...,
                        "female" : ...,
                    },
                    "people_targeted" : {
                        "total" : ...,
                        "male" : ...,
                        "female" : ...,
                    },
                    "funding_used" : ...,
                }
            ],
            "total_action_funding" : ...,
        }, 
        {
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
if field is null, remove that field from the output. so if in "people_reached" there is no information on "male" and "female" return:
{
    ...
    "operational_strategy" : [{
        ...
        "executed_in" : [
            {
                ...
                "people_reached" : {
                    "total" : ...
                },
                ...
            },
            ...
        ]
        ...
    }]
